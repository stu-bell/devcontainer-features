# NOTE in this example, the commands color and hello were provided in the original template repo but have since been removed. Instead, change these to test other commands in your devcontainer features repo.

# The 'test/_global' folder is a special test folder that is not tied to a single feature.
#
# This test file is executed against a running container constructed
# from the value of 'color_and_hello' in the tests/_global/scenarios.json file.
#
# The value of a scenarios element is any properties available in the 'devcontainer.json'.
# Scenarios are useful for testing specific options in a feature, or to test a combination of features.
# 
# This test can be run with the following command (from the root of this repo)
#    devcontainer features test --global-scenarios-only .

set -e

# Optional: Import test library bundled with the devcontainer CLI
# See https://github.com/devcontainers/cli/blob/HEAD/docs/features/test.md#dev-container-features-test-lib
# Provides the 'check' and 'reportResults' commands.
source dev-container-features-test-lib

echo -e "The result of the 'color' command will be:\n"

echo -e "The result of the 'hello' command will be:\n"

# Feature-specific tests
# The 'check' command comes from the dev-container-features-test-lib.
check "check purple is my favorite color" bash -c "color | grep 'my favorite color is purple'"
check "check I am greeting with 'Greetings'" bash -c "hello | grep 'Greetings, $(whoami)'"


# Report result
# If any of the checks above exited with a non-zero exit code, the test will fail.
