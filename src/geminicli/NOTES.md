# Supported OS

Tested on Alpine, Debian or Ubuntu.

Gemini CLI runs off Node.js, so it *should* run on any container with Node.js v 20 or higher.

For other OS versions, ensure Node.js and npm are installed before this feature is installed (see [overrideFeatureInstallOrder](https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/#general-properties)).
