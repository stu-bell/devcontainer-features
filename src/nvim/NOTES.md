# TODO: 

Permission denied error when trying to run nvim (on alpine)

install.sh validation step nvim -v doesn't pass an output to stdout, but command nvim is found, so validation step is incorrectly passing

Try OS detection type and use apt install? 

Check that feature config is successfully mounting user config

Make user config path an option

Clone user config from a public git repo

Check test-build.sh - was showing test passing but there was a JSON syntax error in devcontainer-feature.json??
